# icons

In this project, I collect some icons I paint for my work.

All icons are `10mm` high and wide, but it should be possible to scale them to smaller units (like `1em`) or larger units. The icons are available as `svg` vector graphics. Since some browser do not support `svg`s (or support them in a very odd way), I also add `png` versions of the icons, which then are `32` pixels high and wide.
